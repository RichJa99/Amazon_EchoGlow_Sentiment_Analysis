Adam S. Walter,2.0 out of 5 stars,"No parents were consulted during the making or design of this device.Been playing with the glow today with my kids.  I feel like it is deceptive as it is just a light, I feel like when I preordered I was led to believe that it was an upgrade to the echo dot.  I was wrong.  It does not add anything in the way of a microphone or speaker.  You just paid $30 for a very simple light that supposedly interacts with your existing echo devices if you say enough words.  Eg you cannot just say “alexa, set rainbow timer for 30 minutes”. You have to address the light specifically “Alexa, set rainbow timer for 30 minutes on <insert device name here>“. Then you get a pretty light and a lot of wires because you have 2 devices plugged in rather than 1.I would rather pay $50 for a device that had a speaker and microphone with a smaller footprint.  I have plenty of smart bulbs and more than enough usb cables running around the house.It gets 2 stars for the rainbow timer feature which allows for my kids to have a visual of how much time is left.Sorry much like the echo auto this is a dud for me.Edit:  2 hours into having it around and a couple more notes:1. Amazon called me for further feedback which was nice. Kudos to support.2. This sucker does not want to be wet (has a warning) so my use case of putting it in the bathroom for a shower or toothbrush timer is a poor idea.  This also means it is a poor choice for a bedside lamp since kids tend to want a glass of water on their bedside.3. Having it in your kid’s bedroom means they need an echo in there.  Parents everywhere, evidently we were not consulted, evidently the developers are unaware of the major distraction an echo after hours can be.  That is mitigated by freetime but guess what is not usable except by touch now?  Echo glow.  And since I cant put it next to the bed...4. Current Use cases:Visual color clock:  there are better cheaper items out there. Onaroo for one.Remote light: Better cheaper solutions for smart homes.  Lifex, hue, etc.Finally I would like to point out that EVERY echo named device to date that I am aware of has a microphone at least.I cannot think of what to do with it so I will be putting it in the kids bathroom with the echo dot that is already there and see how long it lasts.  Maybe I will save some hot water with the rainbow timer.","Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2019",985 people found this helpful,NEGATIVE,0.9960971474647522
Samie May,2.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE: I've had this for another 24 hours and I'm getting the feeling that this was barely tested before releasing it. As mentioned below, you can't turn the Glow off in tap mode unless you use voice commands or open the app. But you also can't use voice commands to set a timer for it. Last night I asked Alexa to turn off the Glow in one hour and it responded that it set a sleep timer. Four hours later, it's still on. I quietly had to tell the Alexa to turn it off now and it woke up the whole GD House with ""I DETECT YOU ARE WHISPERING DO YOU WANT TO...""How does Amazon release a devise without testing if you can turn it off?!But the cat still gives it 2 stars.ORIGINAL POST:  I know this is advertised for kids, but I bought it to replace a sun simulation alarm clock and to set up a bedtime routine.  My review is a little mixed because I was able to accomplish these goals (kind of), but the actual ""tap"" functionality is a bit annoying.  Overall I'm okay with the purchase.  There are some clunky aspects that I'm betting Amazon will iron out soon.The Good:1. I wanted a light that would gradually turn on in the morning, didn't have to be accompanied by an alarm sound, and could be scheduled for weekdays only.  I already returned 2 mid-priced sun simulation lights because they couldn't do this.  (Why is it so hard to find a sun simulator to do those three things?)  I received the Glow and after a few minutes of set-up, I set my first routine using my Alexa app.  It only took a few minutes to program it to do exactly what I wanted.  I could have used a default option to gradually turn the light up, but I went the more complex route of  adding multiple tasks so I could change colors at timed intervals.  I added tasks of light and tasks of ""wait"" to the routine and it all worked perfectly this morning.2. I was able to set a routine for the Glow to glow blue at night, but I wasn't able to attach it to my current routine of night-time music.  The Glow task does not have a timer feature, so you need to add a ""wait"" task, then add a task to turn off the Glow.  Unfortunately, there is a requirement that music is the last task in a routine...so unless I want music to turn on after the light turns off, it isn't helpful.  I just made a separate task for the night time light.  So I ask Alexa to ""Turn on night time light"" and ""Turn on night time music.""3. The cat discovered the tap feature and is really into it.4. The campfire mode is really cool.  I hope the nifty developers add a cool-tone option so the same effect can be in blues and purple.The Bad:1. It is very sensitive. I had it sitting on the table as I set up my routines and it was constantly changing colors just from the vibrations of the house.  (You can disable the tab feature.)2. You can't turn it off if you use the tap feature.  If you are playing with the color changing taps, it stays on until you go into your app to turn it off, or you give Alexa a voice command to turn it off.  There is a manual button to turn it completely off, but this disables any Alexa connection so routines do not run.You may think that you can hit the button, and then click the button back on, but then the light turns on and you are back to where you started...just wanting to turn the light off without waking people up with a voice command or digging out your phone.  You'd think that a double tap or a long tap would turn the light off...nope..just perpetual light.3. You have to give parental consent to use the light.  I get that Amazon is covering itself by making you virtually sign a consent, but do they have to send a weird email to everyone in the household so that I get a phone calls from my husband asking what I did.  What else is in that light that I need to sign away my rights and inform everyone else in my house that I signed them away?Overall Impressions:This was the same price as the sun simulators I replaced and it brilliantly accomplished that goal. There are some aspects that are still glitchy, but I'm sure Amazon will send out an update to respond to customer feedback.  Amazon is cool like that, and I'll update my review if any of these issues are updated.  If you are buying it for a kid, they will probably like the tap feature and talking to Alexa to get it to respond.  Go for it!","Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2019",437 people found this helpful,NEGATIVE,0.9974091649055481
Michael,3.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, limiting this product marketing to kids is a bad call. I think you'll find there is a much broader audience for this product.Received mine and love the form factor, the light is very nice and bright. The features however cost this review two stars. I am always an early adopter of Alexa technology and I hope, like other products, this too will evolve. Current light settings don't really do much that a typical color smart bulb can't do already. I would very much like to see direct linking to Echo devices so that for alarms you can have a slow sunrise effect to ease your waking transition with an alarm set on your Echo Dot Clock. It would be great to interact more precisely with music playing through a linked device. Additionally I also hope you can also synchronize multiple Glows in future for great effects.So in summary, it's a nice product, I hope it gets better!","Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2019",249 people found this helpful,POSITIVE,0.8701081275939941
Matthew Studney,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this specifically as a wake up (rather - “you can come downstairs“) light for my kids. Meaning at 630 every day, I want the light to turn on to a specific color. A “Green means go” kinda thing.  I have a “dumb” device that does this but it’s a crappy cheap device and needs to be reset too often (power outages, day light savings, etc).To achieve this, I tried to set this up in the device on the echo app, with no luck....I figured it out later that had to set a time based routine.... per the attached picture which took me longer to figure out than it should have.Overall meets my needs and will play with it further.","Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2019",238 people found this helpful,NEGATIVE,0.9996323585510254
Veronica44h,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My review this is a solid 5 out of 5 for what it is. I'm 29. I guess I'm not the target demo. This is a cute little light, I like the colors and I like the design. I did not expect anything outside of that. I like the modes, and the brightness setting. I didn't think that it came with the microphone and speakers. I didn't think that it had any other connectivity besides connecting to the app and letting me set different colors and such.1. Setup was easy for me. Connect to wifi, open the app follow instructions, boom it works. If setup was difficult for you then you maybe don't have your WiFi on or your maybe on the wrong network.2. I like that it has several different colors and modes. The campfire mode is cute but could use a little more work (as far as vividness) but for an unexpected mode, I really shouldn't complain.3. I haven't used the tap feature. It has a button on the back that can be used to turn the light on and off....I've just used that whenever I've wanted to physically turn it off. I mostly turn it on and off in the Alexa app as well as set brightness and other modes. I have turned the light on and off via voice command. ""Alexa, turn Veronica's light off/on."" Easy peasy lemon squeezy turns it on and off.4. I haven't used the timer feature. I didn't buy it for that. I bought it as a cute lamp that interacts with my Alexa app in an easy way. I don't really get the whole productivity light anyway. Is a rainbow timer really going to get anyone to do anything? I'd probably forget I even set it for that.I think if you were disappointed with this product, then you maybe had some incorrect expectations or weird setup issues.So far so good. I like it and plan on getting another one or two for my office. I reaaaalllly want a wall mount with cord wrap for this so I can stick it directly on some sockets.Edit: I have a two socket outlet where I have this plugged up. In one I have my Echo Show the other was free. Didn't want both taken up so I just plugged the cable into a double USB power socket. My cam, show and glow all work just fine with this setup. Not sure why people are saying this will take up extra outlet space. I'm starting to think people want to complain for the sake of complaining.","Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2019",223 people found this helpful,POSITIVE,0.9977920055389404
Jon Almada,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was one of the early purchasers of this light and had problems from the get go with it. First off, the Wifi was very touchy but I finally got past that by moving the light closer to the router and finally got it to connect. Secondly, Amazon's process for ""adult verification"" was not working correctly and caused me problems that ended up with me talking to my bank due to the problems Amazon had with the light. I wrote a pretty rough review and was going to return the light, but got a call back from Amazon and we managed to work out an agreement to have them look at what happened to me. I waited for some time for them to get back to me, but evidently we kept missing each other. I resolved to return the light in January, but tried again to get the light registered with Alexa and this time, everything worked. I use mine in my kitchen to save on power for the overhead lights and it is a great little bit of kit. I change the lighting now and again and think it is a pretty awesome little light for what it is.I want to thank Amazon's staff and want to make some suggestions with this light.First off: Adults will be buying this light. Not children. We don't need a nanny-state permission slip to use a light we as adults bought. So my advice to Amazon is to lose the ""kids light"" feature and make it for everyone.Secondly, I love the ""Mode"" feature to let you do different presets, but I'd like to see Halloween, Easter, Fall, Spring, Summer and Winter lighting modes along with some kind of color wheel so we can mix and match colors to create lighting similar to the animations like you get with the ""Campfire"" effect. It would be a nice little add to the Alexa app to control these features and steer more people to this great little light.Third: I'd love to see a family of these evolve from here. I like fiber optic lights and think adding something like this to Alexa control would be really cool to see offered.The Wifi issues seem to be resolved now and I've had a new router installed and it wasn't too tough to reprogram the light to use the new router.In conclusion, it has been a learning experience. I initially was not impressed, but have grown to like this little light. I hope that others don't have to content with the issues I ran into and that Amazon's product development folks listen to the feedback on this. All in all, a great little light and I'm happy with how Amazon actually CALLED ME and listened when I had troubles and then fixed the issues.So would I get it again? I just ordered my second one of these lights to use in another room and hope Amazon realizes more adults will be using these than kids. Yes... even we adults like cool gadgets like this!","Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2019",120 people found this helpful,NEGATIVE,0.9983906745910645
Tundrok,1.0 out of 5 stars,"So many issues. First, the QR code scan for setup failed with error message and manual setup didn't work. I noticed my phone wifi was off so started all over. QR setup failed and manual setup never found the device. I unplugged and plugged back in and manual setup worked.Next, the primer screen goes on to tell me that I must give parental consent even if there are no children in my household. (I have no children) Then a browser view pops up to show a webpage that asks me to agree to sharing all my personal profiles' info with Amazon and the page is pinch to zoom which caused an issue in that I accidentally caused it to zoom in a lot.During the end of setup I got an app notification saying ""Echo Glow isn't quite ready yet"" and to go to the Alexa app to complete setup... while I'm in the Alexa app setting it up... and the notification is FROM the app!! Even after completing setup the notification is there.The size of the device was smaller than I expected but that's not a huge deal. The brightness leaves a lot to be desired. The setup showed no details on how to turn it on and off but I found out it's the button on the back. It's extremely awkward to press the button without activating the touch sensitive function that changes the color. Turning it on and off by the physical button leads to inconsistency on the color and brightness you get when it comes back on. Not sure why I can't use touch to turn the device on and off","Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2019",80 people found this helpful,NEGATIVE,0.9996160268783569
releppes,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great little nightlight. Expensive for a nightlight, but lots of nice little features. Works great with an Alexa smart home.Setting up was no more difficult  than other smart products. Which is to say it was a pain in the butt. It never works first time. Ever. After several attempts I was able to get the light to communicate. After setup, it worked better. But then stopped communicating several hours later. Unplugging and plugging back in the light fixed it.Using the light is a breeze. Very responsive and intuitive to basic commands. Alexa makes this super easy.One complaint is the colors seem off. White, purple, red, and green all look okay.  But yellow, gold, pink, and orange look sickly. Orange especially. Doesn't even look close to orange. Honestly, the best color is plain white. I can't fault Amazon to much on the colors. I have a similar night light and have the exact same complaint. I really wish there was a nice Amber color. If a color wheel option was available, one could compensate for the lack of course matching, but sadly the Amazon light doesn't have this. Very disappointing in those regards.One thing I loved about this light are the mood settings. That feature alone is worth the extra $10 (compared to similar products). The campfire and mood modes look great. I wish there were more settings to choose from. Hopefully Amazon can release an update that gives more options.The Amazon quality is evident in this product and I loved that. It doesn't have a battery backup, which is unfortunate. However it has a nice weight and won't roll around. It's smaller than expected, but I liked that. It's about the same size as the Echo Spot.Overall it's a great light. It's a little expensive for the minimal color settings available, but the quality is nice.","Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2019",65 people found this helpful,POSITIVE,0.9786331057548523
SbabyH,5.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE: I have had these in my house for a while now and I'm up to three of them. I love them but to use them as a natural sunrise, you have a lot of work ahead of you. I did a lot of annoying investigation and if you increase the brightness 100% over 20 minutes what happens is from 0 minute to 5 minute it stays at 0 brightness, then at 5 minute it jumps to 25 brightness. Then for minute 5 to minute 10 it stays at 25 the jumps to 50 brightness. Then from minute 10 to minute 15 stays at 50 brightness then jumps 75 brightness. Then at minute 20 it goes to 100% brightness. So it's super annoying but to create the natural sunrise. How I achieve this was by, I put in a 2% brightness then a wait for 2 minutes then a 4% brightness and then I'll wait for 2 minutes, and then I continue on. For me 30% brightness is a good wake up light, so I have it pause there for about 20 minutes before I have it finish out to 100% and then reset to 1% and turn off. I included screen shots so you can see. But once you get it set up correctly it is awesome!!So I bought this for my daughter as a gradual light wake up clock. This takes, in my opinion, some finesse to get it set up right. I included a screenshot of everything I figured out. We also use the light as a ""green means go"", when she is allowed out of bed if she wakes up but before the light. So it is set at a daily time of 6:45 it turns on green at 50% brightness for half hour and then turns off. So in your routines, you choose your light to turn on whatever color and brightness then you add a wait function for 30 minutes and then you add an off function.So if anyone wants to use it as a natural sunrise there are a couple steps I would recommend. The first step is to turn the light on at a 1% brightness, I would love to use a color but they nearly don't get bright enough at a full 100% to make it actually wake you up, so I used white. Then I put in a wait for 1 minute. Then you do the brightness with the increase, you want to set it to 100% so that it goes from 1% to 100%, I did the duration for half hour, that's your decision. Then I had a wait for 1 minute for when the gradual increase with over. since I wanted it to stay on at 100% for 30 minutes, so it was an on, with brightness at 100%, then another wait for 30 minutes. Then I had it turn off.I love the ability that this is voice activated. Since my daughter's schedule is different every day, once I'm up and I know she needs to be up within a half hour I can turn this on from any of the echoes in my home.Long-term, no idea how this will be. For now and the price it's a pretty good deal","Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2019",41 people found this helpful,POSITIVE,0.9964062571525574
Eric,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am very loyal to Amazon.  At last count we have 10-15 Amazon devices in our house.  My wife pre-ordered one of the very first Echos years ago.  We have dots, shows, firesticks, kindles, etc.  So needless to say my kids were very excited when I ordered this.  We received it on November 20, 2019 which I believe was the first day they were available.  My first impression was . . .Meh.  But, I figured it was brand new and they would send out firmware upgrades to give it more usability.  NOPE. . .  Whatever. . .my kids still enjoyed making it change colors.Fast Forward to April 2020.  I upgraded my wifi router which meant that I had to reconnect all my devices.  All my echo devices handled the router change like champs. . . That is except this one.  I may not be an expert, but I am no technical slouch.  So, I contact Amazon technical support and spent two hours on a chat with them going through all the steps to reconnect it.  First they said there was an issue with my Alexa app.  So, uninstalled and reinstalled it. No dice.  They had me do, I don't know how many resets of the glow which did nothing.  We removed it from my devices. . . At one point, it was constantly blinking green and blue, but the tech had no idea what that meant.After about two hours of going through all this, it was finally determined that there is a problem with the device.  Fine. . . send me a replacement.  NO CAN DO.  The warranty already expired. SERIOUSLY?  Yep. . .While all other Echo devices have a one year warranty, for some reason this only has a 90 day warranty.  It's almost as if  they knew that it was a piece of junk.  I even pulled the, ""I've been loyal to Amazon since 1998 and have been loyal to Amazon devices"" card.  Yeah, I know, not the classiest move.  But, apparently there is nothing that they can do.  Honestly, it is truly disappointing.  Not so much because I'm out the money, but because Amazon won't stand behind their product. . . Oh well.  Live and learn.

J. Isabelle,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a feeling this is a problem with Echo integration and/or Amazon's web service but we have many things that work great with Alexa and this is by far the worst which I find really surprising. Most importantly, when we ask an Echo device to turn this light on or off, we have to do it 3, 4, and sometimes 5 times. What's strange is that ""her"" response to ""turn off 'Blah'"" is usually ""There is no device named 'Blah'"" over and over until it works. It always works eventually. I keep checking to make sure the name is what we think it is in the Alexa app.We can turn on and off every other light, fan, lock any lock, etc. using Alexa and it's great. This device seems to be the only hang up.All that said, the function of the device, when it works, is perfect for our daughter. The ""routine"" to start ramping up the light level in the morning when we want to wake her up is great but it doesn't start at the assigned time everyday and, with the voice integration being so shaky, I have to use the app to get it going some mornings.","Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2020",No Data,NEGATIVE,0.9985756874084473
Jamie G.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"We have owned our Glow for about 6mo now. It lived on my 9yo bedside table next to his dot.Pro: Gradual wakeup and rainbow timer (+2 stars), super easy Alexa integration without needing to install another app (+2 stars).Con: Finicky voice commands (-1 star), overpriced for essentially a smart bulb (-1 star), and poor power supply cord execution (-1 star, see picture).As the photo shows, the power cord is connected directly to the Glow rather than have a separate pull out cord. This device has lived on my 9yo's nightstand with very little movement this entire time, and we have cord breakage. I can't imagine this will hold up to the preschool and toddler crowd.

normspo,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had been following the Echo devices over the holidays, bought a few more.  I never even noticed this product.  A friend ended up giving it to me for a gift.  I think this would be a pretty cool notification device, changing colors based on events.  I think the Alexa app has enough features, and is extendable through IFTTT and other tools.I tried to do something simple through the Alexa controls--turn on at Sunset, turn off at 11PM.  I don't think it is actually working--the light is on the next morning.  So, not sure about it being reliable for notifications.Otherwise, it works great as a light, is voice controllable, touch works great.  It's reasonably bright for a night-light sort of effect.  So, great for kids, fun for a bit for adults.  We'll see if I can get it to do something actually useful.Oh, and it is super easy to set up, and just as easy if you move from one wifi network to another (tested at friend, then moved to my network).","Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2020",No Data,NEGATIVE,0.8836653828620911
Jim Di Liddo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have one sitting on my nightstand to give the room a soft light for the dogs. I just ordered two more to use as accent lights throughout the house. I like the different colors you can set it to and the programmed sequences like Campfire are very cool.My only negative is the Alexa app. It's clunky, not simple enough to use and needs a re-engineering effort.In my opinion, Amazon should split device control from the Alexa app and make it a separate app.  And add Apple Shortcut functions so I can control ""scenes"" and devices from a single button on my iPhone.The only reason I keep buying Echo/Alexa devices instead of switching to Apple Home gear is the price for Alexa/Echo devices is more affordable and the number of different devices available. I love my Echo Input, which kept a small Bluetooth speaker from being moved into the ""junk drawer"" and I'm holding off in buying the Echo/Alexa Clock until it has a backlight or at least it can be read in a dark room. I like that I can buy ""starter items"" like the Input and the Dot and eventually move up to a more feature-rich device if I want to.So, a big thumps up for the Echo Glow and Dot and a ""Wait-and-see"" grade of C+ for the Alexa app.","Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2020",No Data,NEGATIVE,0.581538200378418

We did have several weeks with an issue of it not responding in the app or to the echo dot and it took about 45 minutes of googling to figure out how to resolve the issue, a pain, but it is functioning properly once again.Overall, it's a fun device for the younger kiddos and we look forward to learning more of its functions","Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2020",No Data,NEGATIVE,0.9866907596588135
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have my pro and con for this light.First please make sure you read the description. We scored this light for $10 instead of $30 because Amazon gave us 20 off.I was looking for a nightlight for our child and this popped up so I decided to give it a go since it was cheap AND it was an Alexa.I didn't read that it was only a light. I assumed we could do normal Alexa stuff. Nope. It's just a light.Our child likes it. He taps it to turn it on and that's it. I can change it from my phone. I can set routines which couldn't figure out how to do more than 1. Also telling our other Alexa to set a timer for the light doesn't work half the time so I gave up on that. It just stays on all night.Controlling the light from the app doesn't work half the time as well. Brightness, colors.

Kevin J. Deissler,1.0 out of 5 stars,"So for all intents and purposes, this could be a great product. I really liked the features for my daughter's room. She loved it too. It worked fine during setup. Then it eventually became unresponsive. The chat support suggested I move it closer to the router. That was 10 feet away in the next room and when I removed the light and re-added it to my network, of course it worked, just like when I originally set it up. Worked great, again, during setup. However, when I walked away and tried to either turn off the light or turn it back on later, or create a routine for it to go off after my daughter was asleep, it was unresponsive. Sent it back, got a new one. Same thing. So it doesn't like my network, I guess, even though it will work, but not for a long duration. Because I can't call Amazon support due to them not receiving calls (which is kind of ridiculous for a company so large to not have IT work from home), this item is going back.

Father of 4,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So I was mostly planning to use this for the kiddos. They are young enough to need a bunch of help in the morning and it helps if they are at least getting up by the time I get to their rooms. You can set a wake up alarm light timer thru the echo that will give the audio portion of the alarm. You can not set one thru the app, which is inconvenient as you have to remember to mention that it is a wake up alarm, with light x, for what days, and at what time. Then it will populate in your alarm and timer tab of the Alexa app. You cannot add a light to a pre-existing alarm. It must be a wake up timer and I have not been able to figure out how to get another color for the timer. I wanted to do green for the weekend so they don't get out of bed too early but that doesn't work (I actually wanted a gradually brightening red light that then turns green, no such luck).So basically it has a warm white light you can use for a wake up alarm, it can do a rainbow countdown alarm and otherwise it is a mood light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2019",No Data,NEGATIVE,0.9980461597442627

It does have some cool functions (camp fire mode is very pretty). I think the value is okay, considering it is comparable to a Hue Color bulb.I'd prefer if it had a dot or full Echo built in to save space on the night stand. I think some of the advertising is/was misleading and some people are expecting that this has an Echo Dot built into the light, which is leading to some disappointment. To be clear, the device is simply a smart lamp, you'll need a smart speaker in addition to this lamp to actually use it. You can tap it to change between the various functions, and a button on the back turns it on and off. You can also speak to any of the smart speakers in your home to change functions, color, or turn it on and off. It's exactly like having a Hue Color Bulb in a normal lamp with some extra specialty lighting modes, and the inclusion of a hardware button to turn on/off.","Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2019",No Data,NEGATIVE,0.5732020735740662

I haven't moved it out of my room yet. I love the thing. Its a nice little light that isnt too bright and I can get ready for work in the mornings without disturbing the wife sleeping.

Christopher,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Abstract: The device itself works very well. Extremely quick and easy to set up, connect with an Echo device, and the light functions very well and can get surprisingly bright. However, the integration with the Alexa app and its functions still seem limited.First, I will start by saying that I did not purchase this for a child. Rather, I purchased this light with the intention of using it as a wake-up light in conjunction with my Echo alarms. This was not as smooth as I had thought it would be. I also intended to use it as an ambient light in my small room that I could control with my voice from my bed through Echo, which it does very well.After setup, I immediately tried to set up my existing alarms in the Alexa app on my Echo to turn the light on when the alarm begins. That way, there would be both the audible alarm with the light turned on at the same time. I soon learned that this is not possible through the Alexa app. After speaking with customer service for a while, they informed me that this function is not yet accessible. Rather the closest that I can get to this function is to set up a routine in the Alexa app which turns on the light upon dismissal of my alarm. In this way, the alarm sounds without the light on, and when I acknowledge and dismiss the audible alarm, then the light will turn on after. Still a useful function, but not what I wanted.I am mostly frustrated that this option wasn't thought of and there is no current way to enable this in conjunction with an Echo. The customer service representative was polite and kind and said that Amazon is constantly taking feedback for more features, but this one seemed like a no-brainer to me. Oh well, I can only hope that sometime in the near future this will be an option in the alarms on Alexa app.The light itself is great and works very well. Surprisingly bright in my smaller bedroom, and at full power on white color (the brightest color) it illuminates the room enough for me to get clothes from my closet and get ready without turning on my ceiling lights.","Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2019",No Data,NEGATIVE,0.9895352721214294

The next day I received a call from Amazon support and they had informed me that the device had to update and indeed did update later the prior day. Apparently I tried creating a routine before the device had a chance to update.Everything considering I am happy with the device. The reason for the 4 starts is that I think I found a bug when creating a routine. If I create a routine where it turns the device on, then ramps the brightness down to any level over any period of time, then turn the device off, the Ramp Brightness action will not execute, nor the turn device off. I found that if you remove the device off action, it works as intended, except it wont turn the device off. Maybe be you need a delay between the two actions?

I would have preferred if it had the speaker and microphone and light all in one. The stars I gave are reflective of the current price because I don't feel it is even remotely worth $30.","Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2021",No Data,NEGATIVE,0.9826723337173462
Chris Pauly,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We don't use any of the timers, but having the ball lamp in the nursery gives the kids something to talk about and play with.  They can tap on it to change colors and when I turn it off and on using the phone app is magic to the kids.  I like how well built it is made; I don't think the kids will break it when they slap/tap it.  The cord is long enough to let me plug it in away from the outlet. Overall a nice device. I wish it had other options like set moods based on songs/stories spoken on the paired Alexa.

Well let's just say this thing is definitely kid approved. First off she plays with it, closely supervised of course since it is plugged in. She actually puts her face on it and sings and has tried to bite it but the size and shape prevents her from being able to get her teeth in it. Also she has tossed it like a ball a few times and so far it still works perfectly.

You can if needed though.The light itself is a little smaller than expected (Cantaloupe) but perfect for a night light or around your entertainment center.  It puts off a nice variety of colors.

The pictures don't really tell you how small it is.But more importantly, your family's and specifically your child's privacy will be lost with the use of the device.This review is not about Alexa listening in on your child's conversations. It is about Amazon availing themselves of the fact that the device was created for children so they can tap into all the information your Amazon account might hold on the children. When you set it up, Alexa tells you that you MUST give parental consent to be able to use the lamp. Even if no child is using the lamp or if there is no child in the home.But here's the kicker: in giving parental consent to your children's profiles, you are also giving Alexa consent to your own!

Your consent will apply to Amazon's collection of personal infomration in connection with all kid services requiring permission.""It then goes on to list all the profiles under your Amazon account to which you are granting it access.

Karen Herring,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this for myself (no children in the home) and I am loving it. I had been using a nightlight skill on my Echo for a few years but sometimes Alexa had a hard time understanding my sleepy voice and by the time I said ""Alexa make my night light glow"" 3-4 times until she finally understood what I was saying I was wide awake lol. This little light is perfect. I still use Alexa to turn it on & I use it several times a night from the time I go to bed and then get up for the day & thus far, Alexa has understood me every time. I named it Archie & I just give Alexa the command to turn Archie on/off, increase/ decrease brightness, etc. I like the fact that I can adjust the brightness  - for example, when I first go to bed I like it a little brighter when I am arranging my pillows (I call it nesting); sometimes I leave it on all night. Having green eyes makes me very sensitive to lights especially at night & this gives me the option of changing to a color that does not make me squint or wake me up in the dead of night. I prefer the rotating colors but you can set it for a solid color or a campfire effect. It does have a disco effect but I haven't found much use for that but I am sure the kids would love that. You can set a timer or use it to help wake you up. I have 4 cats & it helps me see who is on the bed with me in the dark. I used to like it pitch black in the room but after a health scare this past summer I added a constant nightlight in my bedroom and I had yet to find one that didn't bother my eyes. I read this was coming out & pre-ordered it in September and I am glad that I waited & got this before buying anything else. I am all about Amazon and Alexa enabled devices & this is definitely a useful tool to add to my collection of devices in my home. You can change the setting from Alexa enabled to tapping the light to turn it off & on but mine is not on my nightstand and that wouldn't work for me. I don't see a need to have one in every room but I am sure if I had children in the home they would all want one. I remember when my daughter was a baby I installed a red bulb in a lamp in her room because I had read it would allow you to see without causing the wake up effects of a regular bulb. This would have been great to have back then & I could have experimented with different colors to see which worked best for my situation. The rotating colors blend seamlessly from one to the next creating a soothing effect if you are looking at it. I just got it so I can't speak as to how long it will last or what to do if the bulb(s) go out but I am sure a call to customer service will result in a quick answer when/if that time comes. There is no batteries so a power outage will be miserable since I am already attached to the convenience of it.

gsxr,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This was recently given to me as a gift. It is a good device, not great, with some shortcomings. Yes, it is made in China, says that right on the bottom of the device. Hopefully many of these are software issues that will improve with future updates.Out of the box, it is an attractive light with a quality feeling glass dome, so be careful that it doesn’t get dropped and broken, especially when being used by chilldren. The power cord is a shiny white cord and plug that looks like something from the Apple universe, and it also has a large tag that has to be cut off, or annoyingly left in place. I had to be careful not to nick the power cord when cutting it off. I guess if this cord needs a warning, then every corded device that a person can buy needs a warning. And in order to activate the device, I had to go online, sign an Amazon electronic consent form, and enter my credit card CVV code, or it would not let me use the device. Since Amazon already has my credit card information, this was not so much a financial privacy issue, as just annoying. They do this because the device is marketed to children, but to my knowledge, a lot of toys can be bought on line from Amazon without signing consent forms. Maybe it was just put there on advice of Amazon’s legal team. I wondered if they want a consent form for seizure prone children, maybe because the light can be made to flash different colors, as in Disco mode, or flicker, as in Campfire mode? If so, I did not see a seizure warning on the consent form.Set up is fairly easy, and the instructions are included in the box. I set it up from the app, not from a Amazon Echo device; the app was fast and easier. For my other WiFi enable lightbulbs, I just needed to say “Alexa, set up my WiFi devices,” and they all worked. That did not work with the Glow, but using the app was fast. The Glow does not have a microphone, so it doesn’t take voice commands.The first and most difficult problem is that frequently, and this is very frequently, the Glow loses the WiFi Connection. Commands are frequently and intermittently responded to by “Sorry, ‘Glow’ is not responding,” if you name the device Glow. I tried different names for the device, none of the names affected this intermittent non-responding problem. If I wait one minute, it might work again without doing anything different, then a minute later, it may or may not respond again. Even when it loses the WiFi connection, the tap function and the switch on the back still work. The WiFi connection can be reset by going through the setup function again with the Alexa app, but this is time consuming and frustrating, and then the device will work for a few minutes, then start losing the connection again. It could be that the WiFi connection is weak for this device, but at least where I have it set up, there is an Echo Plus and an Echo Tap nearby, and it is only about 40 feet from the router, and the other devices continue to work fine while the Glow loses the connection. The Echo Plus is just inches away and almost never loses the connection. In addition, I have found that unplugging the device, and plugging it back in and waiting half a minute generally will reset the connection as well. This is faster than going through the app. I would be curious to see if this is just the device I received, or if it is a problem with others as well.The light is not very bright. It functions fine for entertainment for kids, (it is marketed for this purpose, so this is not a negative) but the kids get tired of it after a few minutes. It works as a night light, haven’t had it long enough to see if it fails due to losing the WiFi connection, but the first night it worked fine. It can be set to augment an alarm to wake up in the morning, but for the most part it should be set to white light and maximum brightness, and even then, probably should have a traditional alarm right next to it, because it is not likely to be bright enough to rouse most people from sleep. When it is in a color mode, it is even less bright, as is to be expected for the most part.  It can work fairly well for mood lighting in an otherwise dim room.The timer works fine, but again since it frequently loses the WiFi connection, it may be frustrating to set the timer.Regarding software updates, like with all Amazon devices, some of these may improve with future new hardware generations of the product, and it is not always clear that older products will be supported with future software releases. Sometimes this is due to limitations of the old hardware. Sometimes there is the maddening suspicion that the limits on software updates for older hardware is a way to force consumers to give up on old hardware and purchase new hardware. This occurs with Apple, Amazon, and many other devices. However at least with Amazon, the devices are usually much more economically priced, and the value for the product sometimes make it worthwhile to upgrade the hardware.All in all, it is a nice device; it would be better if the WiFi connectivity issue was not there. It is a reasonable first iteration and inexpensively priced, though maybe priced higher than some similar devices that are not in the Echo/Alexa family. Not certain I would buy another, but if the WiFi connectivity is fixed, and if future lights are a little larger and brighter, I think its niche could be expanded and it will become more popular. For example, I could see a lot of people wanting an Alexa enable device such as this, and paying more for it, if it was larger, brighter, had an onboard Alexa enabled speaker, and could be used as a morning wake up timer to gradually fill the room with light, especially for those living in Northern climes where it is darker in the morning and darker for more of the day. Unfortunately, it is not there yet.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2019",24 people found this helpful,POSITIVE,0.9591107368469238

It’s works well enough and the price is nice.The good:- inexpensive, colorful smart bulb- easy to program via Alexa app- no mic, so no spying in the bedroomThe not so good:- bulb does not get very bright. More like a nightlight or dimmer nightstand light. Look elsewhere if you need a brighter light.- no mic, so if you want to use voice commands, you need a separate device (but I actually prefer the lack of mic for my purposes)- it would be nice if they had a built-in clock display like the Echo Dot since I imagine most people will use this on their nightstand.- it would be nice if they had a sunrise sequence for lighting; one that goes from red to orange to yellow to white.  And, although you can program the light to ramp up/down the brightness over a period of 5-60 minutes, it does not always do so very smoothly. I have mine set to ramp up over 10 minutes, but it does so in a stepwise fashion instead of gradually increasing the brightness at a consistent pace over that 10 minute period.","Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2020",12 people found this helpful,NEGATIVE,0.9957874417304993

Not a huge deal as I have a bunch of Alexas already, but I was hoping it could function as an alarm clock and night light without another Alexa device in the room, it can’t. I bought this as an adjunct to my Echo Show. I use my show exclusively as an alarm clock. I know it can do a crap ton more, but honestly, I don’t need it to because I always have my iPad on hand. I love the show as an alarm clock especially because my wake up time differs from day to day and I hate fiddling with alarm clock settings. The voice commands are so nice and I like having the clock face to look at. The one thing I wish the show had is a light. I like a soft glow while winding down. Or, the ability to turn on a low light via voice commands for my midnight trips to the potty. (The show has a crappy flash light app that doesn’t allow you to change the brightness via voice commands.) I saw this echo glow and thought it was the solution to my echo show problems. And it totally is. Still think Amazon missed the boat by not including a night light with the show. And likewise, I think the glow should include a built in Alexa. But, they don’t, and having both is a doable workaround. The end result is that show plus glow gives me my perfect bedside setup. The only thing missing is a usb charging port. How I would love to plug my phone into my Alexa at night.","Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2019",13 people found this helpful,NEGATIVE,0.896763265132904
thomas gore,1.0 out of 5 stars,"So for one, this product should be re marketed. I was excited for this as I was expecting this to be an echo lamp I could put in my room. That would be cool. I do not understand the parental approval regarding this considering it isn’t even worth a child operating at this point. I don’t see any value a child would have with this. However if it was an echo as well that could be damaging as well. If their was an Alexa child program instead the options of simple counting, to broader language learning programs could be instituted.This product would be liked by any smart home enthusiast, I don’t feel a child would be attracted to much to this.

Without a connection you cannot change the intensity of the light, it’s just automatically 100% which is much too bright for an average sized bedroom nightlight.

   This was so much better than expected!  My kiddo had a night light, stop light and an old iPad that played white noise and was her clock.

At night she sets her light to the color she wants and then when it’s ok for her to get out of bed I have a routine set for the light to turn green.  She can change the color and brightness with voice or a tap.  For all her pretend play we set up routines for “Let’s go camping” which has a cool warm flickering kind of light and I set the Alexa to do nighttime forest sounds.  We also set up a routine for “Let’s have a dance party!” The light goes to disco mode where it flashes between all the lights (shown in the video) and music starts to play.

T. Waggerby,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was honestly surprised by all the negative reviews on this product. This light is everything the description says it is. It is not advertised as an echo dot. It is a light. So you cannot talk directly to it. You can, however, ask Alexa to turn it on. You can name the device to distinguish it from other smart devices connected in your Alexa app.I saw another review claiming you cannot turn the light off in touch mode; this is not true. There is a power button on the back of the device.You can schedule the light to turn on to specific programmed patterns on certain days and times. For example, if you wanted the firelight setting every weekday evening, this could be set to auto turn on.The light is also fully controllable from the app on your phone. You can open it anytime and see if the light is on/off. You can also dim or brighten the light.My only complaint was that it was a bit of a battle to get it connected to our network. We had to power cycle the light multiple times before it finally successfully went into pair mode. The light will flash when in pair mode. Once in pair mode, it take approximately 1 min to connect. It is only compatible with 2.4ghz networks. If you have 5ghz only, it will not connect.I 100% recommend this light.","Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2021",3 people found this helpful,NEGATIVE,0.9966341853141785

WMK,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Updated 02MAR20:So unfortunately I can no longer recommend the Glow.  I bought this at end of September when it was released, however did not unbox it until after Christmas as it was a gift for my 10 year old (who needs a nightlight). Everything was fine until it stopped communicating one night - to never connect again. (This happened once or twice previously and I just unplugged it and plugged it back in, reconnected and moved on). Now, no matter how many times I tried to connect, delete, reinstall, etc - it just would not connect to wireless. It is right next to an Echo Dot that is not having any issues, however I moved it right next to my router and tried different networks and even a hotspot and it just would not connect to wireless. Tried different devices to connect it with (iPhone, iPad, PC). Just spent over an hour with Amazon (doing the same things I've already tried many times......) and was told that it's out of warranty. I was put on hold while the customer service rep checked with a supervisor to see if I could get a one time extension on the warranty so that I could get a replacement (his suggestion, not mine) and then after a long wait was told that no, it was not approved. I wonder when this does get approved? Apparently not in my case. However, they will give me 15% off of a new one! Seriously? I have a device that worked for less than two full months and I'm going to by another? Thanks Amazon.Now I can see in other reviews that this has also been an issue which makes me even more mad that they are not replacing it. (First they blamed it on my wireless, then my device (iPhone) that I was using to set it up, and then ultimately after going through all of the motions again they know that it is the device but sorry... out of warranty). I think that it doesn't cost them much to replace these for the customers having this issue. Would've went a long way with me but I am definitely not planning on purchasing any additional Amazon devices in the future.Initial review: I got this primarily as a night light in my 10 year olds room. It’s about the size of a softball and I use either my Alexa app or Echo to control it. You can also activate a tap feature via the app that allows you to change color, etc by tapping the Glow directly. I like that there are many different color and pattern options (and even more combinations recently added automatically). My son likes to set his Glow to ‘ocean’ and then have Echo play ocean sounds softly at night. Perfect combination. I also set it up so that the Glow lights up in the morning on school days as a wake up alarm. (I also added Echo to also say a good morning at same time). I love that we can control the brightness of the Glow as well. You can make the light as soft as a small night light or bright enough to light up the entire room. The Glow stays cool to the touch as well.Overall I love it and recommend, whether or not you have Echo or another device in room.","Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2019",4 people found this helpful,NEGATIVE,0.9954620003700256
Marc S,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: Still one star, but a better description why. TL;DR at the end.Amazon called me after I posted a one star review - they wanted to talk through the issues I was having and understand what was going on. I don't think we got anywhere on the call, though now I think I have a better explanation of what went wrong.My realization hinged upon a weird point in my conversation with the Amazon tech - he seemed to think the Echo Glow was plugged into an Echo Flex, but I explained that, no, it's a standalone unit that comes with its own power supply. This bothered me and so... I tried plugging it into my Echo Flex.And, connected to the Echo Flex, it works very well. The Glow has its own WiFi internally, but there's no need for that when connected to an Echo Flex. And the Echo Flex seems to remember its own configuration, while the Glow is designed not to.I don't think all parents want Alexa in our child's bedroom, we wanted a standalone device to help with bedtime and gloomy mornings in winter. The Glow ships with its own power supply, but it's crippled if you use it in that configuration. It can't store settings, so you have to reset it every time your child unplugs it or your house loses power, and sometimes it just forgets. As others have mentioned, the ""Simple Setup"" that works so well with the Echo Flex just... doesn't. You have to go through a manual setup process if Simple Setup fails - it usually does on my device - and if the Glow is not in the same room as my WiFi Access Point, Manual Setup also fails and has to be rerun several times before it succeeds. As it happens, my WiFi Access Point is not in my child's bedroom, so the process is somewhat frustrating.But if you plug it into an Echo Flex, it's immediately recognized and available for Alexa voice commands and control via the app.The standalone operation of the Glow when not connected to a Flex, then, seems really to be an afterthought, and for many parents, likely less useful compared to a $2 nightlight or a Hue bulb. Maybe the Flex+Glow is the normal use case, but for me, it's not.TL;DR: If you only plan on using the Echo Glow as an accessory plugged in to an Echo Flex, it's fine. Otherwise, it's junk.","Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2020",4 people found this helpful,NEGATIVE,0.9990793466567993
Lindsay,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I preordered this for my 10 year old son, who also has an Echo Dot in his bedroom. The Echo Glow arrived yesterday and he loves it!Previously, he had a night light that requires him to manually adjust the time (it only worked on a timer, up to 995 minutes, and pressing a button on the back would increase the timer by 5 minutes) and the colors as well. It would take him a long time to get the nightlight setup and my husband and I suspect that he was using it as a bedtime delay tactic.We are all very pleased with the Echo Glow! My son enjoyed the various modes and colors to pick from - and my husband and I love that it can quickly and easily be turned on with the Echo Dot or with the Alexa app from our phones.The ability to adjust brightness is amazing! When set to white and 100% brightness, the light is very bright! My son even commented that it would be too bright to sleep with it on that setting.Overall, we are all very happy with the Echo Glow and we already plan on buying more!","Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2019",4 people found this helpful,POSITIVE,0.7893615365028381
M.Lynn,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The best little light for any room. We chose to put ours in the hallway. There has been a problem with this home for years. It's old and has a long dark hallway that you literally need a flashlight to see to get to the bathroom at night or even in the daytime on cloudy days. There is no wiring in the hallway either to install a light. It was my Mother's home before she passed  and it has always been this way, until now! This WONDERFUL little lamp was EASILY plugged into the bathroom outlet next to the door. I ran the USB nice long cable out and with it was able to use a double sided adhesive and mount the Echo light directly on the wall ! You can controll it with your Echo dot or other device to power it off and on as needed. No more flashlights !!! We literally played with the light for an hour cycling it through all the light and color adaptations it has. The light is also easily controlled by selecting your request in the Alexa app on your phone or by voice on your app. The brightness can be adjusted from 1% of its visible brightness to 100% . It is quite bright at 100% and I was amazed how much light it put out having a ""frosted"" effect shading. My son enjoys the color selections and gave us a good idea by suggesting that if we are going to the bathroom that we choose a color for Alexa to change the light indicating that someone is occupying the restroom. That prevents a trip down the hall only to find out someone is in there. There are also bedrooms down at the very end of the hall so it helps to get to them as well. I'll post some pictures tonight and I took some today to show the brightness levels. I also connected the USB cord to a portable power charging unit and it worked just as easily there, so it could even be used that way for camping or power outages. All said and done this is the most versatile light I have ever owned and I literally could think of at least 20 more places to use this.

Sunny,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This light is brighter than I thought. I bought this light mainly because I've been visually impaired for over a year now, and I found out red light doesn't trigger my photophobia. It works great for that. I'm not a child, I didn't buy this for a child, but you have to fill out the parental consent form anyways on Amazon. Anyways, there is no lag when I tell my Echo Dot to turn this thing on, although sometimes it seems the Echo Dot have some trouble understanding what colour I want this light to be be set to when I combine it with the turn on command (I'm sure Amazon can easily fix this). Sometimes Alexa does tell me Echo Dot is not responding, but it will still follow through with the command, not sure why.My main complaint and why I took off 2 stars is, other than by voice, you can only turn this light on and off with the small button on the back of the light. There is a tap feature on this device which I've turned off as I almost never use any other colour other than red. I wish there would be an option in the Alexa app to turn on tap on and tap off mode so you don't have to reach behind the light and press the little switch. I don't think this would be very hard to program in.Overall nice light, but Amazon could add in some new features to make this light easier to use.","Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2020",2 people found this helpful,POSITIVE,0.9353335499763489

Anthony,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After reading the reviews, I still decided to get the glow. Now that I have it, I have realized there are some misconceptions about what this device is and is not. It is NOT a kids echo, they make one of those...get that if you need a smart speaker for kids. So what is this then? Think of it as blinkers or flashers for your car.You can add the glow to your existing echo routines. Maybe you have a go to bed routine, you can add this as a nightlight that gradually turns off. I have this set as a wake light in the master bedroom, it goes from off to 100% light over the course of 30 minutes for a relaxing wake alarm. I also added a step in my good morning routine to turn it off. By the way, I read some reviews that stated there is no way to turn it off without using your voice on an echo...that is not the case, there is a button on the back that turns it off. For those with babies, you can add a routine for checking on the baby that turns the glow on at a reduced level to not wake the baby.You can also use this as a visual alarm for the hearing impaired or as a visual cue for you or your kids to do something. If you take care of someone and need to make sure they can reach you in another room if they fall or need help, you can put glows in every room, add them to a group and create a routine that makes the glows light up like a siren if someone says “Alexa, get help”. The Built-in rainbow timer functions are pretty cool, especially for kids.All-in-all, it’s a good every day nightlight and wake alarm. It comes in handy for alerts and timers. It is not an echo, so don’t expect one. If you don’t have an echo, you can still use it as a nightlight or wake alarm on a schedule using the Alexa app to setup the times.","Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2020",One person found this helpful,NEGATIVE,0.9989087581634521

Blair,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Although the ""ok to wake"" clock worked reasonably well for my oldest, my 3yo quickly figured out how to open the back and change the time and programming, rendering it useless as a sleep management tool. So needless to say I was excited at the prospect of the Echo Glow. A simple, programmable light that would be tougher for kids to tamper with. Set up was pretty easy and the first night went fairly well - my son was very excited to pick out his sleep and wake colors and proudly bounded into our room the next morning saying ""I waited until my clock turned blue."" However, this morning, he bounded in at 5:15am with the same proclamation, even though the clock was not due to turn blue until more than an hour later. I sleepily trudged into his room and discovered that yes, his clock was in fact blue. After looking at the Alexa app programming, I still have no idea why.

Veronica.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So I purchased this device like many others as a pre-order. I was super excited for my five year old to open it. I was disappointed at the size, its the same size as an Echo Dot (1st/2nd gen) a little smaller than 3rd gen echo dot.  *but my fault for not reading the dimensions and it sitting next to an Echo Dot* It's definitely a night light and not a ""lamp"" as they claim. I feel like they should not have classified this as an Echo Device as it is NOT an ECHO and REQUIRES and ECHO. For us that was fine as she has her kids echo dot. But honestly all it is, is a smart light. I wish it were a little brighter being we have the option to dim it and dim by percentage a little more lumen would have done this great, but again this is my misunderstanding of ""LAMP"" versus ""Night Light"". Multiple colors and some colors have interchangeable names like she can say ""teal"" and it will turn the light ""cyan"". The ""tap"" is SUPER sensitive. It's sitting on my desk so I can ""play"" while she's at school and it picks up every time I hit the keyboard. Then other times it's not sensitive enough little one practically has to slap it and to avoid abuse of the light ESPECIALLY BEING THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR A KIDS PRODUCT she sticks to voice commands. The modes are pretty great she really enjoys ""Disco"" but Alexa has a hard time putting the light in different modes. I have been able to get her to put it in campfire mode by voice though ""Alexa, put light in campfire mode"" but then when i say ""Alexa, put light in rainbow mode"" she responds with ""okay"" but doesn't make that change.

Using multiple routines I’ve set it as a night light and disable the tap. I then have the morning routines ramp the green light up to signal it’s ok to get out of bed/wake. During the day the tap feature is enable and kids have fun tapping and changing colors. At bedtime our gentle wind down routine sets to white light and stays on for a set period and then dims down. We’ve always used a “OK to wake clock” and it functions fine but this gives some added features like being able to disable the morning routine if they are sound asleep and you don’t want the light to wake them.This lamp does exactly what it says it does, is well built and stable.","Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2019",3 people found this helpful,POSITIVE,0.7515294551849365
Katie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for fun for my youngest child. She has a dot in her room and we have set up routines on the app to have the Dot and Glow work together. She says “alexa, bedtime” and her Glow lights up to a nice blue at 50% and does an ocean blue light change. Simultaneously, her Dot will start to play thunderstorm sounds. The white light at 100% is bright enough for her to read in bed. Since she has a Dot, she can lower the brightness, change the color, change the light mode, turn it off/on and set light timers by voice. Her morning alarm is set with a routine to turn on the Glow and for her dot to play music. She also has her morning routine setup to play on her dot with various reminders and alarms and her Glow changes color for different tasks.It’s so pretty and calming with the light changing modes and will probably buy one for my room just because it’s so pretty.It would work fine with just the app or tapping it, but I recommend getting a Dot to work with it. It only took a few minutes to look up setting up routines and even my child can set up routines with the app for both devices to get them to function in the way she would like. It’s also fun for her to set the rainbow timer for things like straightening her room or staying on task.

Derrick K.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"When I saw the Echo Glow I had the idea that an Echo-controlled RGB sphere on my desk might be a great way to relay information at a glance using routines to set the state of the light. My idea was something like: exterior door opens, set brightness 50% + set color red. I can report that (at least with devices linked through SmartThings) the reaction time is far too slow to be useful - often more than 20 seconds. For comparison, a hue bulb linked to SmartThings can change color in response to an event in just a couple seconds. You may have better luck if you're using an echo with a built-in zigbee hub to control your smart devices.That said, the light is soft and pleasant, the colors are bright and vibrant (with the possible exception of the blue), and the 'campfire' mode really does illuminate like a small campfire in a dark room.

There are several to choose from like fire truck, which is red and orange, underwater which is greens and blues, siren which is red and blue, color flow, which goes through all the colors, and several others.Now my gripe- Alexa can not recognize some of the color modes to save her life- mainly color flow. She says she doesn’t know the color 3. I have said it as clear as I can and so have others. I have to use the app on my phone to change it to this mode, which of course is my son’s favorite.

Bratiskim,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this to replace a lamp next to my bed. It’s less than 5 inches in diameter...it could fit in the palm of an adult’s hand. I guess it’s size makes it good for a child’s bedroom but if they made this slightly bigger, I think more adults would be willing to buy it. I like its brightness at 100% and the colors are good for winding down at night.I feel it’s a bit too sensitive at times. I don’t have a nightstand, I have a small rectangular table next to my bed. It’s not flimsy but isn’t heavy either. If I bump the table with the tap feature on, it’ll change colors on me...yet at the same time, I have to kinda slap the Glow to get it to change colors. I may just need more time to get used to it. I don’t want to disable the tap feature.I also wish Alexa was integrated into it with a speaker. For my purposes I had to buy an Echo Flex to go in my bedroom as my Dot is in my living room. I’m happy that I bought the Flex as I can now use Alexa as a supplementary alarm clock...but it makes more sense to me for the Glow to have it already built in. I spent $55 for the Flex and the Glow. I would’ve been willing to pay that amount if it meant getting a Echo Glow with a speaker...maybe call it Echo Shine? Echo Beam? Echo Beacon?

Cormac,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay, so I wanted to post an update to my original review (shown below)... First off--THANK YOU to Amazon's tech support for your fantastic service. I had planned to call tech support to see if there were any ideas as to how to fix the problem described below but before I got to it THEY CALLED ME! On Sunday afternoon no less. Clearly Amazon pays close attention to the reviews people post. Their first call gave me some suggestions to try and said to get back in touch if they didn't work. Well they didn't work so I planned to call the next day but ran out of time. Then before I could get to it the next day THEY CALLED ME AGAIN! At this point I was utterly dumbfounded by the incredible level of customer service being provided--I mean really, who does this? Anyway during the second call we did finally manage to trouble shoot the problem and get it working. The solution we found was that there was a needed firmware update that wasn't happening due to my router not being pointed to Google's DNS servers (8.8.8.8) -- something I normally do right away with a new router but as the eero routers came in the midst of Christmas, I just hadn't gotten that done. So once the router was pointed at Google's DNS servers I had to unplug all the routers except the primary one attached to my ISP modem. At that point the update happened quickly, the glow started working correctly, I brought all the other routers back online and moved the glow to it's final position and it continued working properly. It has been working properly for several days now without issue so I think we can safely say, ""problem solved."" Hallelujah! Oh, and to top it off, Amazon called back again the next morning to verify that the glow was still working properly! Wow. Just wow.So in the end, I'm moving my rating from 1 star to 4 stars. The customer service was 5+ stars. However I still have to ding the device just a little because the problem was caused by the glow needing an update it couldn't get because of a compatibility issue with my router's default settings. I'd normally let this slide but in this case the router (an Amazon Eero) and the device (an Amazon Echo Glow) were both brand new and arrived on the same day from the same company (Amazon) and yet for some bizarre reason were incompatible until I manually repointed the DNS server address. That seems like a somewhat dumb oversight and has to dock the rating at least a star.That said, the device works, my daughter is elated, and I look like a hero in her eyes. So, yeah, Amazon's technical assistance absolutely rocks! Thanks!----------This is just a totally defective product. Got it for my 7 year old daughter for Christmas and she loved the idea but the REALITY of it made her want to cry and me want to crush it with a rock.Set up was a breeze and for the 5 or 10 minutes that it worked, it was fun. But then every time she’d ask Alexa to change the light we’d hear “Echo Glow is not responding.” I checked our eero app to see if it was online and I could see it continually connect and disconnect from wifi over and over. Amazon says to just unplug it and plug it back in and it will reconnect—FALSE! It NEVER reconnects so you have to go into the Alexa app on your phone and delete the device and then manually set it up again. I did this no less than 20 times on Christmas and every time it would stop responding after a few minutes. So I decided it must be a defective unit and requested an exchange.A week later we had a new echo glow. I set it up and everything seemed to work just fine. Until... “Echo Glow is not responding.”  Same exact thing. So this time I decided maybe it just has really lousy WiFi antennae so I moved a router into the same room about 10 feet away and set it up again. Everything worked fine... for 7 minutes and then, “Echo Glow is not responding.”At this point I can definitively say that this is a systemic problem and this product is just absolute junk. Thanks for that Amazon! Please in the future, before you release a product specifically target at kids, try a little harder to make sure it’s not junk. I cannot even begin to understand how this product has anything but 1-star reviews. Oh and for anybody that may think it’s just user error, I should tell you that I’ve worked in IT for over 10 years with 3 major corporations and a major research university. Pretty sure that I am not the problem.","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2020",One person found this helpful,POSITIVE,0.9567235708236694

Dom Villari,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a nice little enhancement to an echo-based on home - take the lower star reviews with a grain of salt. Those folks were expecting to get a full echo device for a relatively low price. The title and description are fairly clear in my view about it being a complimentary device. The price is also in line with cost of most multi-color LED smart bulbs with the added feature of built in power. My daughter really likes having it as a night light and reading light and likes changing up the colors. The only reason I’m only giving four stars is that Alexa isn’t quite as flexible with the command of this device yet. You have to request actions with the right phrasing she’s expected. With the more seasoned devices you can ask things multiple ways and she’s usually able figure out what you want. You do have to name it, but again this is standard for all smart lights and bulbs. They have unique identifiers so that you turn them on and off individually. You can also add this device to a larger light group to command the whole group at once.","Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2019",2 people found this helpful,POSITIVE,0.9973165392875671

jmnixonexp,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Prior to receiving an Echo Show 8 as a Christmas gift our smart devices in our home were primarily that of the ""other"" company. Switching from one interface to another was a breeze. Different, but an easy adjustment as we were heavy Amazon users anyway.After receiving our echo show and seeing this item on sale it seemed like the perfect addition for our toddler who has loved interacting with Alexa. I'm not at all let down with the fact that it does not have voice integration, we actually prefer it this way so that our daughter cannot control it on her own.All in all this thing works great for our 3 year old daughter who tends to do well with a schedule and specific instructions. If the light is red, stay in bed. If the light is green, you're allowed to get up. She caught on immediately and loves to watch the different color settings throughout the day.My only let down thus far is the use of the routines. It seems pretty straight forward to create the routine if you're at all familiar with IFTT technology but somewhere along the line it does not seem to be doing what I've instructed it to do. The scheduled routine rolls around and there is a color shift, but not to the appropriate color or the brightness is at 100% when the routine clearly says something much much lower. We've only had it 3 days so at this point I'm still assuming user error somewhere along the line.I will update my review once my scheduling issue has been resolved.","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2021",No Data,POSITIVE,0.9961069226264954

If I want the light to turn off after 15 minutes I have to say a VERY specific phrase: ""Alexa, set a 15 minute sleep timer on [child's name]'s lamp."" So annoying! To do something that I should be able to say ""Alexa, turn off [name]'s lamp in 15 minutes"" Please, Amazon, fix this!!!2. After I set a sleep timer, the lamp loses whatever mode it was in and goes directly to solid color white. So my youngest daughter likes to fall asleep to the campfire mode. I have to set the sleep timer on the lamp, wait 10-45 seconds for it to turn white, then set the mode to campfire again. SO ANNOYING!","Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2020",One person found this helpful,NEGATIVE,0.725578248500824
T.M.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Update on 8/4/20: One day I tried to turn it off and instead put it into setup mode. Since then, my Alexa app always says that the light is unresponsive and it will no longer do what I tell it to. Somehow we got it to where it now just blinks different blue colors when it is plugged in, but it won't do anything else and will not sync to Alexa.Original review:This needs worked on. I am very happy with the price. I got this for a special deal of just $5. But I would not be happy if I paid full price. This thing doesn't work very well. If you have the tap on, it changes colors all the time without you touching it. My son goes to bed with it on a certain color and he keeps waking up in the morning with the color changed to green. I do like the special modes it has, but those can't be activated using Alexa. I have to manually go through the app to activate them. Alexa always tells me she can't do that. I hope they work on this product and fix all the glitches.","Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2020",One person found this helpful,NEGATIVE,0.9972187280654907
geth1138,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a fun little light. It will fit anywhere a 4th gen echo dot will fit. It shows up nicely in Alexa, but it has no ability to choose a color on a slider. It has some preset options and seems to respond to most color names that work on other smart lights. I have it set up in a routine that turns it on when I turn the alarm off, which is fun. It's handy to have a light and compact smart light that I can sit on a small adhesive mount shelf.That said, if you're buying this at full price there may be other small smart lights out there that serve you better, and the fun modes like ocean and campfire might not be worth paying more money for the same or less functionality. The timer is something that could easily be done with smart bulbs if Alexa's software allowed it. I know this because at first the name of my glow was similar to the name of the smart bulb in my room and they did everything together including timers, which would be cool if you could do it on purpose.Anyway, I like the little light and it's super easy, but a little bit of effort with a smart light app would probably get you similar if not better results. If the small size and no effort Alexa integration matter to you, though, it might be just what you want. I do think you should wait for a sale, though.","Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2021",No Data,POSITIVE,0.9962270259857178

Windhoundfan,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I read the description when I purchased this, so I was not disappointed to find that it has no speaker.  Totally love that it has a decent glass dome and not some plastic crap!  The size is nice...not too small, not too big.  I did not by this for a child,  it was for me to have a gentle wake up in the morning.  Sound alarms (even music) just startle me way too much and this little light works perfectly!I had some trouble starting it, but customer help at Amazon is great and it was soon working.  I have not had any of the issues that others have had with it not staying connected.  Set the wake up time by the Echo, that also shares the same room with this light, and it has done its job waking me up everyday.  Just in case the light alone doesn't wake me up...  there is a sound alarm once it reaches its brightest light level (about 15 minutes to do so).  So far, just the light itself has been enough to do the job wonderfully.As to the campfire setting... its disappointing.  It flickers, but not too realistically.  Rainbow is cool, but really wish this light could do some other effects.  How about the flickering blue of being under the ocean?  Maybe even some night time stellar effect of stars?  Hopefully we will see Amazon develop this light to do more in the future!","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2019",One person found this helpful,POSITIVE,0.9925450682640076
y0bailey,4.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE TO ORIGINAL RAGE-FILLED REVIEW:All of my troubles were due to how sensitive the ""touch"" function is.  This night-light is on a bed-stand with a white-noise machine (Dreamegg D1).  If the white noise machine is on, the light is non-stop sensing ""touches"" and just cycles colors over and over no matter what you tell it to do.  Now that I have figured this out I have just disabled ""touch"" in the app and things are fine.  Would be nice to be able to adjust touch sensitivity as it seems a bit overkill on it's responsiveness.ORIGINAL RAGE-FILLED SLEEP DEPRIVED DAD REVIEW:This thing is absolutely terrible.  It has 1 job, which is to be a night light, and it can't even do that reliably.I put it in my infants room so I can have some red-light to feed her at night-time.  No matter how you turn it on (phone app vs. voice through my other alexa devices) it just turns her bedroom into a rainbow dance party.  SUPER HELPFUL AT 3AM!Literally every other smart-bulb in the world can do this properly...yet Amazon can't make an amazon device to function in it's amazon echosystem.It's buggy as hell, and even if they manage to update it, I still have wasted my life trying to troubleshoot it, and had it wake up a sleeping baby....it's a zero star product at best.","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2019",2 people found this helpful,NEGATIVE,0.9897925853729248
Em,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this in July but just opened the box & set it up yesterday - bc I'm a habitual procrastinator 😕.It was super quick & easy to set up - provided you already have the Amazon app installed & have set up/used other Alexa devices so that you know what youre doing - and even if you don't; the directions are super easy.And it responds well to my Echo Show5.My only complaint (at this time) is that it keeps turning up the brightness all by itself. Like, all on its own when no one was even talking at all. I sat there and watched it turn the brightness up as far as it could when I was sitting there silently & my daughter was sleeping. So yeah, kinda irritating bc my daughter doesn't need her room all lit up at midnight. Its done this 3 times so far. And bc I would have interrupted the white noise playing on our Echo Show5, if I had asked Alexa to dim it, I had to move it from the nightstand to under the bed (I didnt want to unplug it & possibly have to set it up again or end up with the issue I'm having after I unplugged my lamp for a few minutes before plugging it back in - now, it responds fine if I manually turn it off/on using the Alexa app on my phone but when I ask Alexa to do it; she continually says my lamp ""isnt responding"".....but it works just fine if I physically turn it on/off in the app. 😠.....so yeah, didnt want to have that happen with this too so its gone under the bed 3 times now 😕  I'll update if I ever get an answer as to why its doing this.But other than that its pretty cool. ✌","Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2021",No Data,NEGATIVE,0.9204201698303223

Kim,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This light is cute, has multiple color options, modes, and timers. I’m using this as a night light for my daughter and I’ve set it up through the Alexa app. Unfortunately, even though every routine is set up to be at 5% brightness, it keeps shifting to 100% in the middle of the night. It will light the room up brighter than a100watt lamp. I wanted something that would turn on at 7:00 so my daughter would know when to wake up. It’s keeping her awake. My husband unplugged it several times when it’s super bright, which means I have to set it up all over again. After the 10 min set up and I’ve checked to make sure all the “routines” are 5% brightness, it’s at 100% again this morning. 🤦🏻‍♀️Update: Amazon customer service to the rescue! A very nice woman called at an inconvenient time and at my request called me back an hour later. Very much appreciated. She taught me a simpler way to set up a routine. I have come to the conclusion that the light was being changed manually by a small child, (not a huge surprise) who will not be rewarded unless the light changes green on its own. The app is a bit complicated and takes a little getting used to, but if you already have Alexa stuff, you’ve probably already got that part figured out. This was my first Alexa item. Hopefully I’ve got all the kinks worked out.

Jennifer L. Marendt,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have wifi that toggles between 2.4GHz and 5GHz. Naturally, I didn't know to look or think to look what kind of wifi requirements this thing has before purchasing it for my son as a birthday gift, because my Echo Dot was set up on my home wifi effortlessly. Well, that's not the case with this. I have been on the phone with Amazon and my internet provider for hours trying to get the wifi configured so that I could set up this thing, and it's been unsuccessful. I think that it's absolutely ridiculous that you have to have specific internet requirements to hook this thing up, especially when I already have an Alexa device set up and this thing is just a glorified nightlight that does a few tricks. I was going to return it, but decided to keep it since it does still do what I had originally purchased it for. However, my son and I are now both really disappointed that we can't connect it to the Dot and make use of the Glow a little more easy.

Dennis Shats,4.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought Echo Glow as a part of a bundle deal for our 5 year old kids.  Even though the product is designed with a minimalist approach and looks simple to use, the issues are in coordination of it with Alexa app.  It seems like the product was created and then as an afterthought the decision was made to put it in the app.  For example if you want to set up an alarm, that is done in the alarms section.  But if you want it to glow on a countdown every night, then you need to set up a routine which is another function.  When you are setting up the routine, there is no separate section for echo glow but rather you need to dig into the manuals to see that you need to go to ""Smart Home"" and then ""lights"" section to find it... All of these deviations are very confusing and hard to decipher and put together for the lamp to work properly.  Sometimes we noticed the lamp just simply does its own thing and we have no idea why since there is no clear feedback mechanism set up in alexa app... With all that said, I understand that its not exactly the product's fault, however since it so heavily needs to rely on the app to function properly the result is still lackluster.  Kids love to tap it though and it changes color, or during a dance party it glows different colors.  I would say the integration is the weakest point that needs to be revamped in alexa app.  Finally, if you don't plan to connect the lamp to any network or app, then it works great, just don't expect much of it :)","Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2020",No Data,NEGATIVE,0.9977351427078247
leebosay,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This lamp has a lot of potential, if Amazon adds more flexibility in the future. It's just ok as a lamp. As a timer or alarm, it leaves a lot to be desired.Rainbow mode is nice (where the lamp changes color every few seconds.). But it can't be used in alarm mode. And the alarm sound comes from your Echo device, not the lamp. So if they're on opposite sides of the room, it's kind of weird.As for timer mode, sure, the colors change as the time approaches, but what color means what? Does blue mean five minutes to go? Ten minutes? Nobody knows.I was hoping to be able to set a recurring alarm every afternoon in rainbow mode to remind me to get dinner going, but this device can't do that.

I didn't want any listening devices in my kids room, just a nightlight that I could set brightness and have it auto off.It is fantastic at this.  It is the best night light I have found and nothing else is close.  You can adjust the percentage down by small increments.  I set 1 of them at 6% and one at 10% because my one daughter likes it brighter.Alexa routines are great. Although I hate how alexa does routines.  I would like it organized better, like the routines nested under the device or grouped by device.  You create a routine to turn it on and a separate one to turn it off.  I would imagine this has a use case, but for simplicity I would like it grouped.Now, I can see how some people might like it nested with a built in alexa.  Amazon should probably offer it both ways because I can see some people wanting an alexa with a night light built in.If you want a night light that works great, this is your device.","Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2019",One person found this helpful,POSITIVE,0.9957376718521118

Michelle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have read a lot of reviews and I don't think people really read about the light let alone even just looked at the picture of the light WITH the ECHO DOT. Everyone kept saying that it doesn't have a microphone, well no it doesn't because it is paired with an Alexa Dot, Spot, or Show. When you add the Echo light through the Alexa app to your devices you give it a name, you then tell Alexa which is your Dot, Spot, or Show, to turn ""Red"" which is the name of mine, ON, or OFF, or what color you want it to be, etc....that is how it works. You must follow the little 3 page booklet to get it added to your devices and get the wifi added. It was simple once I figured it out. And there is a UPC type code on the back of the little booklet that must be scanned at one point. Also have your wifi password handy and a name for your light picked out. My son was amazed and loved that he could control it using Alexa. The colors of the lights are beautiful and vibrant. I do recommend it as usage for light.

Cors,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: My 6 year old daughter is a bit scared of the dark and would need her door wide open with a light on full brightness in our hallway. After 1 night with this light, she now likes to keep all the lights off except her new echo glow, which she has named ""Star"" (trademark pending, per my daughter). She loves to change the colors each night to the one she prefers. She loves all of the color combos, but in particular she likes the Valentines and the Underwater gradient color schemes. Lastly, we created we created a couple routines for my daughter that have been really successful. We created a bedtime routine so when my daughter says ""Goodnight Alexa"" it will turn off all her bedroom lights, turn her echo glow on at 20% brightness and the color she prefers, Alexa will say a custom message we created for her and lastly, Alexa will open Storytime and tell her a bedtime story. So far, she has used Storytime every night since Christmas and has fallen asleep in her own bed without any fights or tears.A couple other Pros for this product are the ability for kids to ask Alexa questions to learn, listen to kid friendly music, play fun games that get your kids up and moving (freeze dance, etc..). In addition, my daughter is also calling Grandmom and Grand Pop to chat as well with the Echo Dot we added with this.Cons: The only cons are that if you child is not at the right age for this device, it may prove frustrating at times. This is only due to Alex trying to decipher kid talk when they enunciate. At 6 years old, my daughter doesn't have much trouble at all. Another con could be that this is yet another device that does pull kids away from everyday life of playing outside, with friends and of course actually having some exercise. This is a given though and as a parent, the parental controls can really help limit how much the device is used. Don't get me wrong, there is no like Iphone addiction or anything with this, but it is in the back of my mind to review how much time she uses it.  The last Con would be that this is a device that does have tons of microphones. If you where a tin foil hat and these mics would bother you, then you will probably not enjoy this much.","Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2020",No Data,POSITIVE,0.9787361025810242

Lizzie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As someone who suffers from insomnia and from constantly waking up during the night, the decision to purchase this lamp was brilliant (pun absolutely intended). I know that a darkened room is best for a restful night, however it’s a phobia of mine that I need to have some form of light on at all times.I’ve tried numerous lamps and nightlights in the past with no success.I originally purchased it for my six year old daughter and ended up using it for myself....however, she has decided that she definitely wants back her lamp, so it seems as if I’ll be purchasing a second one.Granted, it’s a lamp - as the description states - but the integration with Alexa is fantastic AND the fact that this device has ensured that I can finally get a full night of sleep makes it completely worth the price.","Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2021",No Data,NEGATIVE,0.9951565861701965

Raising to five stars for the amazingly versatile under cabinet kitchen light that hasn't caused a fire. The halogen predecessors began smoking shortly after installation. Yikes! Echo Glow is so much better!************We have so much fun with these! Disco mode causes universal groaning. My tween loves to prank her father by switching the color and/or mode as he readies himself for sleep. Finally, the green glowing Echo looks like ""aliens"" may have invaded our house if you are peering from the street. Giggle.However, if your light shares a desk with other items, the color changes with the slightest vibration on the desk (e.g. gently placing a cup of tea on the desk). This is frustrating especially if you prefer a particular light frequency for your current task.Although my husband has no complaints, I would prefer the device emit significantly more light at 100%. I had hoped these would replace table lamps, but they need brighter bulbs before that is an option.Good, but not yet great.","Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2020",No Data,POSITIVE,0.9830605387687683

We will set the brightness and mode and it will automatically switch it to something completely different after a few minutes. We wanted to use it as a nightlight and a fun light and it is useless as a nightlight since it randomly switches itself to 100% brightness in the middle of the night, waking our two year old in a panic. The modes are really neat and fun, you can choose a solid color as well as the brightness which are all features we like. It can be put in routines with the echo (we have echo dot kids edition) which makes for fun morning and night routines. If they work out the kinks of it just randomly doing whatever it wants then it will be a great little light.","Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2020",One person found this helpful,NEGATIVE,0.9918501377105713

I need night and my bedroom is a cage, he nailed blackout curtains all around the 5 windows that are really large and on 3 of our four walls. So I have no natural light either.

Tom Ford,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm a big fan of the Amazon Alexa ecosystem.  I've at least tried most of their devices.  I had a need for more light in a bedroom in the house, and when I saw this, I decided to give it a whirl.In fairness, I probably should have read reviews more carefully, or at least paid more attention to this being called a light for a kid.  It is easy to set up.  The color changing is pretty cool.  Unfortunately, even at its brightest, this thing doesn't produce much light.  In a small basement bedroom (11' x 11', maybe?), when set in a corner, it doesn't provide enough light for me to even be able to see the opposite corner of the bedroom.As a kid's night light, it's great.  It's just not useful as a normal light.  I'd find it more useful it provided more illumination and could just be turned down for use as a night light.","Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2021",No Data,NEGATIVE,0.9204999208450317
emily dutson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this on an amazon deal and I am so glad! I love it! I like to be able to see in the bathroom at night so I need some light. My husband likes it dark. This makes us both happy. It was very easy for the to set up and connect. I am a bit tech challenged and have had difficulty with the echo dot and other techy stuff, so this was great. It just connected and was very easy to set up.There are 12 different mode functions for the type of light. Campfire, Christmas, Firetruck, Underwater, Valentine's, Kwanzaa, Hanukkah and Siren, that all slowly flash between 2 or 3 colors. Campfire flashes with red, orange and yellow. Valentine's are pinks and purples. Christmas is red, green and white. Underwater is various blues. Siren flashes between red and blue, like a police car. I cannot remember Kwanzaa and Hanukkah.There is also color flow, where all the colors slowly flow from one to another. The Disco mode is similar but instead of flowing smoothly, they change like they would if the lights were shining off a disco ball, so more of a flash effect.I am not sure what the mood light mode does. I think it goes between the more subtle colors at a lower glow.I use the solid color setting. I have it set to blue at 5% and it is perfect. Dark enough it doesn't bother my husband but bright enough that at 2 am when I have to use the bathroom I can see where the soap is.I really like that can pick the color and the brightness of the light, so if you want a bright light you can have that and if you want a very dim light, that is easy to get too.The only thing I don't like is trying to set a routine so the light automatically comes on at a certain time and then turns off at a certain time. The first time I tried this, the max I could make the light go on for was 4 hours, which is not long enough. The next time I couldn't remember what I had done and could only set the routine to turn the light on at 9 pm. I have yet to figure out how to turn it off. I wish that part was easier. I do like I can tell my echo dot to turn the light on and off. That is nice.Overall, it is awesome. My kids want one for their rooms. They would have the most fantastic dance parties with the disco light and music blaring.","Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2020",No Data,POSITIVE,0.9997023940086365

She turns on to whatever color I want (or the last color viewed), and my family knows to be quiet in the area and not come in for a conversation.  It is small enough to not stick out into the hallway but definitely large enough to attract everyone's attention.

elkile,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I finally installed this for my little 3 year old niece. She was delighted with it. It is very simple and basic, but she is happy with that so I am happy! She was very excited to have an alarm set for 8 am and to wake up to the pretty color yellow with it. I will have to find out how that went over this morning. I left it on Color Flow for her and we chose a color for each member of the family! I told her when the light is green, it means Auntie is thinking about her. We gave dad purple, the dogs got blue and yellow, and Elsa, the omnipresent fictitious character in her world, got white. We even assigned a color for her angel grandparents. So, my niece chose crimson. She cannot really get her mind around the color name though. My only real issue is that pink is not a color in the repertoire.... little girls want and need pink and do not get it when they ask for it (Insert image of disappointed child here). The lamp has a pink color, however, being that it is named crimson she will need to expand her knowledge of the color spectrum. She is a quick study and she certainly needs to learn new things all of the time... however, it is a simple nightlight, so it would have been easier to just name the pink color pink. Otherwise, it is a pretty and fun little device. I think the price point is a bit high given its simplicity, but it is not insurmountable. I like that the Glow was easy to install.

Lauren,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I want to love this lamp but I can’t given it’s limited functionality. I bought it knowing it was just a lamp - but a smart lamp. It changes colors and amuses my toddler. She loves the rainbow mode and I think campfire looks really cool in a dark room. So as nothing more than a light that changes colors, it is pretty neat and a good bargain. However, the two features I bought it for are not great. First, the rainbow timer: I assumed you’d set the rainbow timer for say 10 minutes and it would change colors, then at the end of 10 minutes the light would go out. Nope. At the end of the timer the light stays on and your echo timer just goes off.  So basically it is just the light on rainbow mode and the timer doesn’t really integrate with the lamp. Second, the wake up light alarm: I assumed this would be like the sunrise feature on the echo show 5 and that the light would start out dim and gradually get brighter until the alarm time. Nope. At one minute before the alarm time the light cuts on set at white light and full brightness. No gradual brightening at all. So basically it’s just turning the light on. Because kids love to be awakened to jarring bright lights. My takeaway is that amazon really needs to give way more information in their product descriptions and maybe even include videos of the products working because that would have changed my mind about buying this particular lamp.","Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2019",No Data,POSITIVE,0.9922391176223755
Sean Ogden,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ended up getting this randomly as a deal of the day for very cheap. Prior to seeing the advertisement I never heard of it. My daughter LOVES IT! The features are super cool with the different colors you can pick for it including an underwater setting that changes variations of blue and green, Valentine’s which is variations of red, and a whole lot more including it changing a rainbow of colors though that could be a bit distracting for your child trying to go to bed. Some other cool features is setting up voice codes with Alexa. When I say “Alexa bedtime” it activates the light to go on. One of my favorite features has to be setting a time for a light to turn green so they know it’s time to wake up or okay to come and wake me up.

It's great for our son's room, we can use it to help him soothe to sleep, and we can get a little more light out of it when we need to do a midnight diaper change, much easier than the full-brightness of the overhead light.The installation was a pain.  I had to accept some extra terms of service which was only available through Amazon.com so it took me out to a browser and I had to use one-time passwords and change my password twice before I was able to accept the terms and then go back in.  For a couple of days it kept asking me to complete the setup but then it finally figured out that the setup was complete.The only thing I don't like is that I haven't figured out how to set a timed-fade-out in Routines.

You can also sync this device with your Alexa home security devices so that they turn on and off while you are away from home in order to deter burglars.

Seamus Davidson,3.0 out of 5 stars,"As shown in the photo, I have 2 of these Echo Glows set up in my bedroom near my Echo Show 5. I can tell my Alexa to turn them on and off with relative ease, and they look really great and bright. However these lights are not without flaws. My biggest complaint is how I can’t combine both of these glows into ONE light so I can just tell Alexa to turn it on and they’ll both come on (I set up a routine so that when I say “color on/off” it toggles their power but they’d still be better combined). It would also be easier to sync up their color in one command instead of two, or one click instead of like 8 in the Alexa app. I also don’t think the tap to change color feature is practical, and I turned this feature off on both of them, as sometimes they would change color if I was simply walking around my room (too sensitive). I also wish I could set the Glows to any color of my choice using some sort of color wheel, like the Philips Hue bulbs have. Another nice feature would have been music responsiveness, like if the colors changed or flared with the beat of music played through my Alexa device. P.S. A quick note to the marketing team ;) marketing these lights to kids is also kind of a misfire because mood lights are very “in” right now with people of all ages.All in all a pretty cool product, and pretty affordable, but a little more work should have gone into both the hardware and software.

blckpanthercom,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This product is very... ""Routine"" oriented. Never got into them, now I'm forced to learn, quickly.Alexa voice control - powers on, changes colors, and types. Check.Timer function - Lacking, severely.Parental control - Understood, but seriously. More adults are going to buy this for themselves than for kids. It is a glowing orb!Turning it off - kind of a joke unless you have your phone or want to yell across to your Echo device.Routines - Forced, at least it feels that way. Created a bedtime routine, Lights off, Glow on color green, wait 10mins turn Glow off, and then turn thunderstorm sounds on... now, because the Thunderstorm Sounds are a skill it is forced to be at the bottom. That's the rub, I get that it has to access basically a secondary app to open the skill, but seriously, but having to wait 10mins for the sounds to start which also turns off the Glow is just not right. Can you fix this feature. How was it overlooked? Even for children, parent says ""Alexa put childname to sleep""... it turns off the lights, turns on the Glow (nightlight), starts a book/sounds and then X time later, it turns itself all off. I'm fine with adding a ""wait"" to the routine, but still... the skill issue should be resolved, for this exact concern.Mic/Speaker - Honestly, not a big issue to me. I get how it could be an improvement and useful.No water - See, the Glow would be awesome in a bathroom. or even on a nightstand. But steam might be an issue, the notations were not that specific. Also, people are clumsy and might knock liquids over on a nightstand. A couple rubber seals/gaskets would solve this concern.All in all - It does what they say it does, it should do more I am quite shocked that some of the common sense features are missing. Learning the ""Routines"" system is a learning curve. It could be so much more though, so update please, I also understand that this is a first run beta/customer review period, I am sure many realize it also, so we wait for the update.","Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2019",One person found this helpful,NEGATIVE,0.9982326030731201
stormcat,5.0 out of 5 stars,wish there were some morepleasing colorsI being an adultbought this on saleknowing  it’s meant as a kids night lightwe usually keep battery powered candles on at night because its a gentle light and good in the event you wake during the night for the restroom or etc  and something like a candle light is pleasantthe colors the glow puts out are for the most part tolerable but  not pleasanti use the red at night  a lot of the other colors are harsh  the red could be better  probably due to the thick white plastic of the glow  the red isn’t horrible at night and it was cheap so ill give it a thumbs upif you can get it cheap  definitely a good buyif you can get it cheap,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2021",No Data,NEGATIVE,0.8562474250793457
AshleyTayla,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this as an alternative to the many “ready to wake” style lights and clocks. I bought it knowing it was not a speaker and didn’t have a built in microphone. All of that said, it does EXACTLY what I need it to do, plus it has fun extra capabilities I wouldn’t get with a typical ready to wake set up.I use the “routines” function in my Alexa app to set up a “winding down” routine with lavender lighting an hour before bed, so that my first grader and preschooler can look at books or play nicely while I get my infant ready at night. At bedtime, I have a routine that turns the light to a salmon color. The kids know that once the light is red/pink, they can only leave their room for potty or an emergency. This has worked very well! Our morning routine starts with the light turning green and the kids knowing they can come into my room or join me downstairs. Perfect set up for us. We’ve also used the rainbow timer if I need them to play quietly upstairs while I work from home or take a phone call. They enjoy watching the colors change and knowing when their quiet playtime is over.The fun new light show features have been cool to play with, but because we keep this in their room, they’re not missing out by not having an Alexa voice command service in their room to active them. It’s fun to bring the Glow downstairs for “dance parties” or playing pretend with the campfire or fire truck mode, though.Overall I am very pleased with this purchase. I do think it is priced high, but I should have looked for it on Black Friday, I suppose.","Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2020",No Data,POSITIVE,0.9045048952102661
